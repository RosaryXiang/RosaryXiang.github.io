# View C++ as a federation of languages

Rules for effective C++ programming vary, depending on the part of C++ you are using.
There are **four** sublanguages:

- **C**: Way down deep, C++ is still based on C. Blocks, statements, the preprocessor, built-in data types, arrays, pointers, etc., all come from C.
- **Object-Oriented C++**: This part of C++ is what C with Classes was all about: classes, encap sulation, inheritance, polymorphism, virtual functions, etc.
- **Template C++**: the generic programming part of C++.
- **The STL**: The STL is a template library. Its conventions regards containers, iter- ators, algorithms, and function objects.
